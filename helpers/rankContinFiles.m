function [rankings, spikesFound, spikesRates, noiseSpikes, whichChansDisabled] = rankContinFiles(continFolder, thresholdFiringRate)
% [list] = rankContinFiles(folder)
%   Takes a folder of contin files and uses very quick version of spike
%   detection to determine which continuous files are more likely to
%   produce best/most spikes.
%
%  PARAMETERS:
%    1. continFolder = folder containing all contin files to rank
%
%  RETURN VALUES:
%    2. rankings = list of ints ex: [5,3,7,1...] where index
%    represents ranking of continuous file and rankings[index] = channel
%    of that file.
%    i.e. in this examples, channel 5 is best, 3 is second, etc...

% NOTE: assumes file titles in default format return by OpenEphys i.e
%       (processerID_CHx.continuous) where x is the channel number. And
%       that files are in order of their channel number!
% ALSO: Uses random to not favor any type of spike time difference 
%       correlations. 

% 1. Cycle through each continuous file in folder

% TEST DATA
% rankContinReturn spikes found:
%  [ 214   162   154   150   164   178   191 ]
% rankings:
%  [ 1     7     6     5     2     3     4 ]
%
% load_open_ephys_data/spike detect spikes found:
%  [ 778   147   128   113   143  178   348 ]
% rankings:
%  [ 1     7     6     2     5     3     4 ]
%
% HOWEVER: note that since algorithm runs using random numbers, rankings of
%          channel 2 and channel 5 flip flop pretty frequently for this
%          particular data set.
