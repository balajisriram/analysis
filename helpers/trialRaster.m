function [ raster ] = trialRaster(sess, trials, unit, range)
% trialRaster - takes a list of trials, a single unit, and a range, and
%               returns a raster indicating the how many times the unit
%               appears in each trial.
%
% Parameters: trials - list of which trials to check for correspondance.
%             unit - which unit to count for in each trial.
%             range - [before, after] in number of milliseconds to give a 
%                     buffer of time in which how close a spike can occur 
%                     to be considered due to that trial.
%
% Return: raster - cell array of length(trials) where each cell contains
%                  indices of all spikes that occur within range of of
%                  stimOnset of trial
